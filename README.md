# [Focus Dude !!!](https://asyrafff.com/focus-dude/) 🧘‍♀️

A simple chrome extension that helps you **stay focused when you work with your computer on the web.**

It is easy to **lose focus** when working on the web because there are **so many distractions** that are available!

So to help you prevent your future productivity from decreasing, you just have to **activate the Focus Mode!** by using **FOCUS DUDE!!!** extension ✌️

I have a problem consuming too much HackerNews 😅 ([read my full story](https://asyrafff.com/focus-dude/)), so I build this extension for me to stop that bad habit.

## Demo

## Functionalities (when activated):
✅ Block a predefined list of distracting websites (Facebook, Twitter, HackerNews...)

✅ Motivating shitty quotes for you to get back to work 💪

✅ Regex support

✅ By definition, it is a simple extension.

## The Workflow

## Run Locally

1. [Clone](https://github.com/asyraffff/focusdude.git) or [download](https://github.com/asyraffff/focusdude/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) an archive of this repository
2. Navigate in your browser to `chrome://extensions`
3. Make sure that **Developer mode is active**, using the toggle switch in the **top-right**
4. Click the **Load Unpacked** button toward the top-left, selecting the [ext](https://github.com/asyraffff/focusdude/tree/master/ext) directory in this repo

#### Once installed, you can use the extension by:

1. **Clicking the icon** in your extension toolbar
2. **Adding your desired websites** one per line to the text box
3. Press the `update` button to activate the extension which will block any of the sites in your list


## Future plan

✅ Update manifest to V3

✅ Change the redirect URL to my own subdomain name.

✅ Implement ON/OFF Button
> this is not important. But if there is a high demand, I'll do it.

✅ Timeout (maybe, I don't know)
